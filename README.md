# Emblem
This is a work in progress project. The general idea is that a user can scan any monitor running Emblem, and their device will be able to view a live feed of that monitor. 

#### Q: Why not just use a QR code?
A: QR codes can be difficult to scan from far away, at an angle, or in challenging environments like poor lighting. The goal of an Emblem is to provide a smaller, simpler, and more robust scannable object that works reliably in these situations. By specifying certain properties of the Emblem, it reduces complexity and ensures faster and more consistent recognition, even with basic camera systems. 

#### Q: I'm still not convinced - aren't QR codes fairly reliable?
A: Emblems address issues of trust and usability that QR codes often face. While QR codes are versatile, they can lead to anything, including potentially malicious sites. In contrast, Emblems are designed to be recognizable as a distinct type of scannable code with a clear and specific purpose. When you see an Emblem, you can trust that scanning it will always provide an Emblem feed, eliminating the uncertainty associated with QR codes.

#### Q: What are possible use cases?
A: This project was inspired by AR technology - in theory, to provide a minimally distracting badge that can be displayed in the corner of a screen. This would allow any AR device (think Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest, etc.) to identify the Emblem and gain access (and perhaps even interface with) a higher resolution feed of that monitor/screen. 

Alternatively, Emblem could be used as an accessibility tool. Imagine you are in Times Square and want to watch the news on a faraway billboard - scan the Emblem and watch from your phone.
