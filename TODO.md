# TODO

## CV
- emblems can be built with pixel masking using a template and OpenCV. Experiment with different shapes and figure out what is the easiest to recognize
- screen detection
- given screen, emblem detection in (bottom right?)
- would a depth cam help? An IR camera?

## host
- host should be set up via CLI
- host should be set up via web app

# subscriber
- web app for subscriber to see host via room code

# server
- simple WebRTC server
- more dedicated WebRTC server like [janus](https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/)

# quality of life
- would it be better to split the repository into several repos? Might be easier to navigate
